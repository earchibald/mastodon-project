# mastodon-project
Looking to build a Mastodon instance on AWS in an automated way.

# DON'T. INCLUDE. CREDENTIALS. EVER.

We want to:
- diagram out requirements - postgres, web app, network
- Implement in AWS
- Iteratively develop ansible playbooks/role to deploy
- or cloudfront? jeez
- dns hostname route 53
